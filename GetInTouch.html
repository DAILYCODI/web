                <p>At the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), a dedicated team of students embarked on a student-led project to build a Hexapod robot while delving into the realms of robotics and artificial intelligence. Through tireless effort and collaboration, they learned the intricacies of mechanical design, electronics, and programming, pushing the boundaries of their knowledge. Despite facing challenges and setbacks, their perseverance paid off as they successfully brought their Hexapod to life, equipped with autonomous capabilities and guided by algorithms they developed.</p>

            <p>My name is Ezequiel Trevino and I will graduating this upcoming semester with a Computer Engineering degree at the University of Texas at San Antonio. As the software engineer for our project, I was tasked with developing a machine learning model with a dataset of over 1000 images. I optimized the model's performance through testing. Additionally, I integrated a Twitch stream for live user interaction, enabling viewers to control our Hexapod Robot via chat commands.</p>

            <p> My name is Dazarus Chapman and I will graduating this upcoming semester with a Computer Engineering degree at the University of Texas at San Antonio. As the software engineer for our project, I was tasked with developing an interface for our hexapod robot to educate students. I wanted to create a webstie that was easily accesbile and has the ability to show and tell others about our journey. Additionally, I integrated a Twitch stream for a live 3rd Person View of the Hexapod Robot.  </p>
